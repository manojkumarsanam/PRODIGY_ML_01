# Prodigy Infotech ML Internship Task 01

This repository consists of the code for the Task 01 of the ML Internship.

## Details:

We have implemented a Linear Regression model on the housing dataset that is provided in the Task sheet. We have to make the model work such that it takes in features like number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and area of the house and predict the possible Sale Price of the house. In this dataset, there are even more features so we have used all the features to develop the linear regression model.
